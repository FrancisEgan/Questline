## Features

- Zone-based quest tracker that follows you as you travel, with a Show World toggle for your full quest log
- Quest badges count from 1 without gaps in Zone and World modes, skipping completed question marks; map and tracker numbers match
- Quest levels with difficulty-colored numbers and level-based sorting; elite quests show a plus, such as `[15+]`
- Click a quest to highlight its map area without changing your tracker page or sorting
- Ctrl-click to highlight multiple quests and move the group to the top, sorted by level
- Precise action icons for single-location objectives and question marks for turn-ins
- Bag, sword, and gear spawn markers for highlighted quests on both maps; world-map spawn markers are off by default and can be enabled in Options
- Questgiver markers on the map and minimap, including wanted posters and other quest objects, with names and available quests in combined nearby tooltips
- Minimap question marks for ready turn-ins, taking priority over an NPC's available quests and hiding the duplicate native yellow dot
